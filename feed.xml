        <p>Hello! I’m Nishi Kanta Paul, a Computer Science graduate from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (Top 7 in class).</p>
        <p>I’m passionate about AI, computer vision, and medical imaging. I currently contribute to an AI-based Parkinson’s Disease Screening project with researchers from UAB and Temple University.</p>
        <p>3000+ problems solved on Codeforces, LeetCode, and CodeChef have helped me strengthen my algorithmic thinking.</p>
        <p>I work as a Trainee Software Engineer at Brain Station 23 PLC, building scalable web apps using React, TypeScript, and Next.js.</p>
        <p>My work on driver distraction detection using transfer learning was published in an international conference.</p>
        <p>I’m now actively seeking fully funded research opportunities in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>AI for healthcare and diagnostics</li>
          <li>Deep learning and computer vision</li>
          <li>Algorithm design & optimization</li>
          <li>Modern frontend engineering (React/Next.js)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Always open to collaborations—feel free to reach out!</p>
